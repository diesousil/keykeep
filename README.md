# keykeep
A tool to save keys and passwords grouped by context. 
Use carefully, preferentially on a local network guarded by high security firewall. 
Don't let anyone know where it is installed, and keep the application password safe.

## Libraries
Developed with [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) framework, and frontend based on [AdminLTE](http://adminlte.io/) control panel template, both free and open
source tools, just like KeyKeep.
